## Features : ##

* A notification will be sent to all the active users within the range of a 10km radius from the user in distress along with her location.
 Hence the responsible citizens would have the opportunity to help those in trouble with the help of our app. :rocket:

* The user would also be able to send some information describing the trouble. However this would also be done by **just one click**.

* The user would be given three options to categorize her message : **low alert , medium alert, high alert** .
  * low alert : This tells the recipient that the intensity of the sos is low. No or minimum assistance is required
  * Medium alert : This tells the recipient of the signal that the intensity of the sos is moderate. They may go to help with some assistance.
  * HIGH alert : This would tell the recipient that the user is in grave danger and maximum assistance is recommended.
*By default the sos signals sent would be of **high alert**.*

Hence this app would be useful in all kinds of distress scenarios. 

* There is also be an **offline feature** wherein the user would provide the details of their known contacts.
These contacts would also recieve a notification and an SMS consisting of the victim's location.
